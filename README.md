Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install mqtt mqtt-json-rpc
```

About
-----

This is a small wrapper around the
[MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) API of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), for
[Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC)
communication based on the [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/)
protocol. This allows a bi-directional request/response-style communication over
the uni-directional message protocol [MQTT](http://mqtt.org).

Usage
-----

#### Server:

```js
const MQTT = require("mqtt")
const RPC  = require("mqtt-json-rpc")

const mqtt = MQTT.connect("wss://127.0.0.1:8889", { ... })
const rpc  = new RPC(mqtt)

rpc.on("connect", () => {
    rpc.register("example/hello", (a1, a2) => {
        console.log("example/hello: request: ", a1, a2)
        return `${a1}:${a2}`
    })
})
```

#### Client:

```js
const MQTT = require("mqtt")
const RPC  = require("mqtt-json-rpc")

const mqtt = MQTT.connect("wss://127.0.0.1:8889", { ... })
const rpc  = new RPC(mqtt)

rpc.on("connect", () => {
    rpc.call("example/hello", "world", 42).then((response) => {
        console.log("example/hello response: ", response)
        rpc.end()
    })
})
```

Application Programming Interface
---------------------------------

The API of MQTT-JSON-RPC is a superset of the original
[MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) API because it is just a
wrapper around it with the following additional methods:

- `constructor(mqtt: MQTT, encoding?: string]): MQTT-JSON-RPC`:<br/>
  Create the [MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) API wrapper.
  The `mqtt` is the [MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) instance.
  The optional `encoding` can be either `json` (default), `msgpack` or `cbor`.

- `MQTT-JSON-RPC#register(method: string, callback: (...args: any[]) => any): Promise`:<br/>
  Register a method. The `method` has to be a valid MQTT topic
  name. The `callback` is called with the `params` passed to
  the remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#notify()` or `MQTT-JSON-RPC#call()`. For
  a remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#notify()`, the return value of `callback` will be
  ignored. For a remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#call()`, the return value of `callback`
  will resolve the promise returned by the remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#call()`.
  Internally, on the MQTT broker the topic `${method}/request` is
  subscribed.

- `MQTT-JSON-RPC#unregister(method: string): Promise`:<br/>
  Unregister a previously registered method.
  Internally, on the MQTT broker the topic `${method}/request` is unsubscribed.

- `MQTT-JSON-RPC#notify(method: string, ...params: any[]): void`:<br/>
  Notify a method. The remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#register()` `callback` is called
  with `params` and its return value is silently ignored.

- `MQTT-JSON-RPC#call(method: string, ...params: any[]): Promise`:<br/>
  Call a method. The remote `MQTT-JSON-RPC#register()` `callback` is
  called with `params` and its return value resolves the returned
  `Promise`. If the remote `callback` throws an exception, this rejects
  the returned `Promise`. Internally, on the MQTT broker the topic
  `${method}/response/<cid>` is temporarily subscribed for receiving the
  response (`<cid>` is a UUID v1 to uniquely identify the MQTT-JSON-RPC
  caller instance).

Internals
---------

Internally, remote methods are assigned to MQTT topics. When calling a
remote method named `example/hello` with parameters `"world"` and `42` via...

```js
rpc.call("example/hello", "world", 42).then((result) => {
    ...
})
```

...the following JSON-RPC 2.0 request message is sent to the permanent MQTT
topic `example/hello/request`:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id":      "d1acc980-0e4e-11e8-98f0-ab5030b47df4:d1db7aa0-0e4e-11e8-b1d9-5f0ab230c0d9",
    "method":  "example/hello",
    "params":  [ "world", 42 ]
}
```

Beforehand, this `example/hello` method should have been registered with...

```js
rpc.register("example/hello", (a1, a2) => {
    return `${a1}:${a2}`
})
```

...and then its result, here `"world:42"`, is then
sent back as the following JSON-RPC 2.0 success response
message to the temporary (client-specific) MQTT topic
`example/hello/response/d1acc980-0e4e-11e8-98f0-ab5030b47df4`:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id":      "d1acc980-0e4e-11e8-98f0-ab5030b47df4:d1db7aa0-0e4e-11e8-b1d9-5f0ab230c0d9",
    "result":  "world:42"
}
```

The JSON-RPC 2.0 `id` field always consists of `<cid>:<rid>`, where
`<cid>` is the UUID v1 of the MQTT-JSON-RPC instance and `<rid>` is
the UUID v1 of the particular method request. The `<cid>` is used for
sending back the JSON-RPC 2.0 response message to the requestor only.
